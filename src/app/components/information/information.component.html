          <h2>What is Diabetes</h2>
          <p>Diabetes is a serious condition where your blood glucose level is too high. There are two main types.<p>
          <ul>
            <li>Type 1 Diabetes</li>
            <li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
          </ul>
          <p> They're different conditions, but they’re both serious.</p>
          <p>Another level to look for is the <u><strong>HbA1c level</strong></u></p>
           <div class="types">
             <div class="type-column">
               <h3> Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
               <p>Type 1 diabetes is a serious condition where your blood glucose (sugar) level is too high because your body can’t make a hormone called insulin. </p>
               <p>This happens because your body attacks the cells in your pancreas that make the insulin, meaning you can’t produce any at all. </p>
               <p>We all need insulin to live. It does an essential job. It allows the glucose in our blood to enter our cells and fuel our bodies. </p>
               <p>When you have type 1 diabetes, your body still breaks down the carbohydrate from food and drink and turns it into glucose. But when the glucose enters your bloodstream, there’s no insulin to allow it into your body’s cells. More and more glucose then builds up in your bloodstream, leading to high blood sugar levels.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="type-column">
               <h3> Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
               <p>Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition where the insulin your pancreas makes can’t work properly, or your pancreas can’t make enough insulin. This means your blood glucose (sugar) levels keep rising.</p>
               <p>When you have type 2 diabetes, your body still breaks down carbohydrate from your food and drink and turns it into glucose. The pancreas then responds to this by releasing insulin. But because this insulin can’t work properly, your blood sugar levels keep rising. This means more insulin is released.</p>
               <p>For some people with type 2 diabetes this can eventually tire the pancreas out, meaning their body makes less and less insulin. This can lead to even higher blood sugar levels and mean you are at risk of hyperglycaemia. </p>
               <p> </p>
             </div>
             <div class="type-column">
               <h3>HbA1c</h3>
               <p>HbA1c is what’s known as glycated haemoglobin. This is something that’s made when the glucose (sugar) in your body sticks to your red blood cells. Your body can’t use the sugar properly, so more of it sticks to your blood cells and builds up in your blood. Red blood cells are active for around 2-3 months, which is why the reading is taken quarterly..</p>
               <p>A high HbA1c means you have too much sugar in your blood. This means you’re more likely to develop diabetes complications, like serious problems with your eyes and feet..</p>

          <h3> Diabetes treatments</h3>
          <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to use insulin to treat your diabetes. You take the insulin by injection or by using a pump. It’s also free on prescription.. </p>
          <p>If you have type 2 diabetes you may need medication to help manage your blood sugar levels. The most common tablet is metformin, but there are lots of different types, see definitions for an explanation of each
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Metformin</li>
            <li>Jardiance</li>
            <li>Gliclazide</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Common side effects of these tablets can include</p>
          <ul>
            <li>stomach ache or indigestion</li>
            <li>feeling sick (nausea)</li>
            <li>being sick (vomiting) or diarrhoea</li>
            <li>constipation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Lots of people with Type 2 diabetes don’t take any medication, and they instead treat their diabetes by eating well and exercising more. <strong>See diet and exercise section</strong></p>
       </div>
        <div class="type-column">
          <h3> Managing your diabetes</h3>
          <p>Make sure you attend all your diabetic clinics at th doctor and eye clinic each year and have the blood tests to check levels and HbA1c and take the medication prescribed to you as per the recommended dose.</p>
          <p>Examine your feet regularly between reviews, or ask someone you know to check them for you.</p>
          <p>Blood pressure will be taken at the clinics and should be <strong>below 140/80mmHg</strong> for people with diabetes or <strong>below 130/80mmHg</strong> if you have kidney or eye disease or any condition that affects blood vessels and blood supply to the brain.</p>
          <p><img src="../../../assets/images/mylife-pura-x-.png">Check your blood sugar levels are kept within the target levels as highlighted in the Sugar Levels section, using a finger prick monitor, test strips and lancets and make a note of your readings.
          </p>
          <p>Keep to a strict diet and exercise if you can, keep treats down to a minimum. <strong>See diet and exercise section</strong></p>
